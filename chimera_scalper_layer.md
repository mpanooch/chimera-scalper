# Fast-Path Scalp Filter (The "Gatekeeper") for Layer 1

Ultra-fast statistical checks to filter out low-probability trade setups.
Acts as a pre-filter before heavier AI models (Layer 2+).
Runs in <1ms to avoid wasting cycles on bad signals.

Ross Triggers (Momentum Breakouts)
Model:
EMA Cross + Flat-Top Detection (price consolidates near highs/lows).
Volume Confirmation (breakout with increasing volume).

Bao Triggers (Mean Reversion)
Model:
VWAP Deviation (price too far from VWAP → expect snapback).
Liquidity Void Fills (detect "holes" in order book).

Nick Triggers (Tape Pressure)
Model:
Volume Delta (bid vs. ask volume imbalance).
Time & Sales Momentum (aggressive buy/sell prints).

Fabio Triggers (Chaos/Entropy)
Model:
Order Book Entropy Spike (unusual fragmentation → inefficiency).
Microstructure Chaos Metric (custom volatility index).

Speed: Even a small neural network adds ~100μs of latency.
Determinism: Hard-coded rules are predictable and auditable.
Interpretability: Traders need to understand why a signal fired.

Random Forest (quantized for low-latency inference).
Logistic Regression (for probabilistic filtering).
Tiny CNN (for pattern detection in L2 snapshots).
Branchless Code (avoid if statements in hot paths).
SIMD Vectorization (e.g., AVX-512 for EMA calculations).
Lock-Free Data Structures (for tick processing).

# Market Regime Classification (The "Context Engine") Layer 2

Classify the current market state (e.g., trending, range-bound, chaotic) to contextualize scalp signals.

Acts as a gatekeeper for Layer 3 (MoE Experts) by filtering out trades that don’t fit the regime.

Runs in <2ms (heavier than Layer 1 but still latency-sensitive).

1. Key Regimes to Detect
Regime	Description	Example Triggers
Trend Up	Strong bullish momentum	Higher highs, EMA slope > 15°
Trend Down	Strong bearish momentum	Lower lows, volume confirms
Range-Bound	Sideways price action	Low volatility, mean-reverting VWAP
Liquidity Event	Large orders causing slippage	Sudden OB imbalance, high delta
Chaotic Spike	Erratic, news-driven moves	High entropy, micro-price dislocation

Models & Techniques
A) Transformer/Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)
Best for: Capturing multi-scale regime shifts (ticks → minutes).
Self-attention spots structural breaks (e.g., trend → range).

Quantization: Use INT8 models (e.g., TensorRT) for 2-4x speedup.
Batched Inference: Process multiple ticks in parallel (if GPU available).
Warm-Up Cache: Pre-load model weights to avoid latency spikes.

Retrain
Trigger: Drop in regime prediction accuracy (>15% decay).
Data: Use recent market data (last 2-4 weeks).
Integration with Layer 3 (MoE Experts)
If regime == "trend_up", boost Ross AI (momentum).
If regime == "range_bound", boost Bao AI (mean reversion).
If regime == "chaotic_spike", disable all experts except Fabio AI.

# Multi-Expert Signal Generator (MoE - "The Brain Trust") Layer 3

Generate high-probability trade signals using specialized "expert" models (Ross/Bao/Nick/Fabio).

Blend or select the best signal based on market regime (from Layer 2).

Runs in <3ms (heavier than Layer 2 but still latency-optimized).

Ross	Momentum Breakouts	CNN + LSTM	regime == "trend_up/down"
Bao	Mean Reversion (VWAP/Liquidity)	Gaussian Process + RL	regime == "range_bound"
Nick	Volume/Pressure Scalps	Attention Model (Time & Sales)	regime == "liquidity_event"
Fabio	Chaos/Entropy Plays	GAN + Unsupervised Clustering	regime == "chaotic_spike"

Mixture of Experts (MoE) Architecture

# A) Gating Network
Input: Regime (Layer 2) + microstructure features (Layer 0).
Output: Expert weights (e.g., [0.7, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1] → Ross dominates).
Model: Tiny neural network (2-layer MLP) or sparse MoE.

# B) Expert Models
Ross AI (Momentum):
Input: EMA slopes, price acceleration, volume surge.
Output: {direction: long, entry: 100.25, stop: 99.90, confidence: 0.88}.

Bao AI (Mean Reversion):
Input: VWAP deviation, liquidity voids, order book skew.
Output: {direction: short, entry: 100.50, stop: 101.00, confidence: 0.92}.

Blending Signals
Method 1: Weighted Average
Combine entry/stop levels based on gating weights.
Method 2: Winner-Takes-All
Only use the top expert (e.g., Ross if weight > 0.7).

# Reinforcement Learning (RL) Tuning
Goal: Reward experts that perform well in their regimes.
Method:
PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) adjusts gating weights weekly.
Reward Function: PnL_per_trade - 0.5 * drawdown.

# Optimization Tricks
Quantization: Use INT8 experts (e.g., TensorRT) for 2x speedup.
CUDA Graphs: Reduce kernel launch overhead in GPU inference.
Expert Warm-Up: Pre-load all models at startup.

# PnL-Driven RL Filter (The "Profitability Gatekeeper") Layer 4

Simulate trades with realistic fills, latency, and fees.
Filter out low-profit signals before execution.
Reinforce profitable expert logic (via RL feedback loop).

Input: Signal from Layer 3 (entry, stop, direction).
Models:
Fill Probability Model (Logistic Regression or Monte Carlo).
Slippage Estimator (Based on L2 liquidity depth).

Reinforcement Learning (RL) Agent
Goal: Learn which experts/signals are profitable in current market.

Model: PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) or SAC.
State Space:
Market regime (Layer 2).
Expert confidence (Layer 3).
Recent PnL of each expert.
Action Space:
0 = Reject trade, 1 = Accept trade.
Reward Function:

Precompute Features: Run fill/slippage models in parallel (CUDA).
Quantization: Use INT8 RL model for <100μs inference.
Hard Reject Rules: Override RL if risk limits breached (e.g., max daily loss).

Accept: Signal passes to Layer 5 (Execution).
Reject: Discard and log reason (e.g., "low PnL", "high slippage").

AI Models:
RL (PPO/SAC) for dynamic filtering.
Logistic Regression for fill probability.
Latency: <1ms (critical for scalping).
Deployment: Hybrid Python (training) + C++ (inference).

# Execution & Risk Control (The "Terminator") Layer 5

Execute trades with sub-millisecond latency.
Enforce hard risk limits (no AI override).
Minimize slippage via order slicing and microstructure-aware placement.

Order Slicing & Execution Logic
Technique	Description	Implementation (C++)
TWAP (Time-Weighted)	Spread orders over time to avoid impact	slice_order(price, size, duration_ms)
VWAP (Volume-Weighted)	Match volume profiles in L2	vwap_execute(order_book, target_size)
Liquidity-Aware	Detect icebergs/hidden liquidity	detect_icebergs(ob_levels) → adjust size

Risk Enforcers (Hard-Coded in C++)
Position Sizing	Kelly Criterion or Volatility-adjusted	size = kelly_fraction(account_balance, win_rate)
Stop-Loss	Dynamic trailing stop based on ATR	stop = last_peak - 2 * atr_14
Daily Loss Cap	Kill switch at -2% daily drawdown	if (daily_pnl < -0.02) halt_trading();
Latency Monitor	Cancel if fill >1ms	if (order_age_us > 1000) cancel_order();

Latency Optimization
Lock-Free Queues	Zero contention in order routing	moodycamel::ConcurrentQueue
DPDK/FPGA	Bypass OS network stack	Solarflare NICs + OpenCPI
CUDA-Accelerated	Parallelize price checks	Thrust + CUDA streams

Integration with Layer 4
Input: Accepted signals from Layer 4 (PnL Filter).

Pre-Execution Checks:
Re-validate risk limits (in case market moved).
Refresh L2 data (last 100ms snapshot).
Compute optimal execution path.

No AI Here: Pure deterministic C++ for reliability.
Speed Tricks:
Lock-free queues.
CUDA for order slicing.
DPDK for network bypass.
Safety First: Hard-coded risk > profitability.
